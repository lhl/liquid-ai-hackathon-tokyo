You are a bilingual expert evaluating machine translation quality between English and Japanese.

**Source text**: {{ source_text }}

**Translation**: {{ translated_text }}

**Reference translation** (gold standard): {{ reference_text }}

Evaluate the translation strictly on:
- **Accuracy**: Does it preserve all facts, entities, and meaning from the source?
- **Fluency**: Is it natural, grammatical, and idiomatic in the target language?
- **Completeness**: Is everything translated without omissions or hallucinations?

Use this 1-5 scoring rubric:
- **1** – Completely wrong, untranslated, or incomprehensible
- **2** – Major errors in meaning, facts, or grammar that severely impact comprehension
- **3** – Adequate translation with the main idea conveyed, but noticeable issues in accuracy or fluency
- **4** – Good translation that is accurate and natural, with only minor imperfections
- **5** – Excellent translation that is precise, fluent, and indistinguishable from a professional human translation

Additionally, mark **<correct>1</correct>** if the translation is perfect and would be acceptable as-is in a professional setting (native-quality with no errors). Otherwise use **<correct>0</correct>**.

Respond with a brief justification followed by your scores:
<justification>...</justification><score>N</score><correct>0|1</correct>
